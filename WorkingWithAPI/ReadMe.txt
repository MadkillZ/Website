I decided to make use of javascript/jquery and some php with this project, so it's important to host this on a apache server. I made use of xamp when running it, since that is what I'm most familiar with. When using xamp just make sure that you go the instalation folder and input the files into the htdocs folder, since this is where the apache pulls it from. (example path Software\xampp\htdocs).

I did a unit test for the errorCheck function inside JS/api.js. To access results you can just go to http://localhost/test.php
